        <h2>... and my new Astro Journey !! ðŸš€ðŸš€</h2>

        <p>Welcome to my corner of the Internet! I'm a passionate fullstack developer living in Argentina. </p>
        <p>My fascionation with technology started when I was young and ignited my journey into the world of software development, where I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development. From designing sleek user interfaces to architecting backend systems, I thrive on the challenges that come with building innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>Beyond my technical pursuits, I'm on the cusp of completing my degree in Systems Engineering. This academic jouney has provided me with a solid foundation in problem-solving, critical thinking, and project-management skils that I bring to every aspect of my work.</p>
        <p>When I'm not immersed coding, you'll likely find me hanging out with friends or watching a movie.</p>
        <p>Join me on this journey of exploration and discovery that we all call life!!</p>
